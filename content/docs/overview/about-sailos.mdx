Sailos is the cloud OS for deploying, managing and scaling your applications in seconds, not minutes, not hours. By embracing a cloud-native approach, it abandons traditional cloud architectures in favor of a new Kubernetes-based model, allowing businesses to use the cloud **as easily as they use their own PCs**.

With Sailos, users can deploy any highly available distributed application on Kubernetes with just one click, much like installing software on a PC, and with minimal operational overhead. Through its powerful and flexible app store functionality, Sailos caters to the diverse needs of a wide range of users.
