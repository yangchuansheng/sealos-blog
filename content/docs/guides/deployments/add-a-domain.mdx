Assigning a custom domain to your project guarantees that visitors to your application will have a tailored experience
that aligns with your brand.

## When Deploying

Just enable "Public Access" when you're deploying, and [Sailos](https://usw.sailos.io) will sorts you out with a
domain.

Now, on your domain provider's end, link the 'CNAME' to the one Sailos provided.

Once it's active, jump back to Sailos, click on "Custom Domain" to the side:

To wrap up, click the "Deploy" button. Once your app's live, click on the external address to access the app via the
custom domain.

## Post Deployment

For the apps you've deployed, just click "Update" top-right on the app details page. Then, follow the earlier steps to
integrate your custom domain.
