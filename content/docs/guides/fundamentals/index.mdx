Welcome! Let's get started with Sailos DevBox!

To begin, you should familiarize yourself with the core components and features of the platform. The goal of this section is to guide you through the fundamental steps of creating, developing, releasing, and deploying your application using Sailos DevBox.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Project | A Project in Sailos DevBox is like an application stack, encapsulating everything needed for your application, including runtime environments and configurations. |
| Development Environment | The cloud-based environment where you write and test your code, accessible through IDEs like Cursor. |
| Release | A versioned snapshot of your application, packaged as an OCI image for deployment. |

The following pages will guide you through how to create and manage your Projects, develop your application, create releases, and deploy your application. They will also explain how to use the various features of Sailos DevBox to streamline your development workflow.

1. [Create a Project](./fundamentals/create-a-project): Learn how to set up a new project in Sailos DevBox.
2. [Develop](./fundamentals/develop): Understand how to connect to your development environment and write code.
3. [Release](./fundamentals/release): Learn how to package your application as an OCI image for deployment.
4. [Deploy](./fundamentals/deploy): Discover how to deploy your application to Sailos Cloud.

By following these guides, you'll gain a solid understanding of the Sailos DevBox workflow, from initial project creation to final deployment.
