After creating your project in Sailos DevBox, you're ready to start development. This guide will walk you through the process of connecting to your development environment using Cursor IDE and running your application.

## Connect to Your Development Environment

<h4>Access the Devbox List</h4>

Navigate to the Sailos Devbox List in your [Sailos Desktop](https://usw.sailos.io).

<h4>Connect with Cursor IDE</h4>

- Find your project in the Devbox List.
- In the "Operation" column, click on the dropdown arrow next to the VSCode icon.
- From the dropdown menu, select "Cursor".
- Click on the "Cursor" option that appears.

<h4>Install the Devbox Plugin</h4>

- When you click on "Cursor", it will launch the Cursor IDE application on your local machine.
- A popup window will appear in Cursor, prompting you to install the Devbox plugin.

Once connected, you'll be able to access and edit your project files directly within the Cursor IDE environment.

This remote connection offers several benefits:
- Your code runs in the Devbox runtime, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
- You can access your project from anywhere, on any device with Cursor installed.
- Collaboration becomes easier as team members can connect to the same Devbox runtime.

## Run Your Application

<div className='steps [&_h4]:step'>

<h4>Open the Terminal</h4>

Open the terminal within Cursor IDE.

<h4>Navigate to Your Project Directory</h4>

If you're not already there, navigate to your project directory.

<h4>Start Your Development Server</h4>

Run the appropriate command to start your development server. For example, if you're using Next.js:
