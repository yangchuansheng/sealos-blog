description: Learn how to connect to Redis databases in Sailos Devbox using PHP
---

This guide will walk you through the process of connecting to a Redis database using PHP within your Sailos Devbox project.

## Prerequisites

- [A Sailos Devbox project](/docs/guides/fundamentals/create-a-project) with PHP environment
- [A Redis database created using the Database app in Sailos](./)

## Install Required Extensions

In your Cursor terminal, ensure that the Redis extension for PHP is installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-redis -y
```

## Connection Setup

#### Create a Configuration File

First, let's create a configuration file to store our Redis connection parameters. Create a file named `config.php` in your project directory with the following content:

```php
<?php
return [
    'host' => 'your_redis_host',
    'port' => 6379,
    'password' => 'your_redis_password'
];
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Redis credentials from the Database app in Sailos.

#### Create a Redis Connection Function

Next, let's create a PHP file that will handle the Redis connection. Create a file named `redis_connect.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php
function getRedisConnection() {
    $config = include 'config.php';
    
    try {
        $redis = new Redis();
        $redis->connect($config['host'], $config['port']);
        
        if (isset($config['password']) && !empty($config['password'])) {
            $redis->auth($config['password']);
        }
        
        echo "Connected successfully to Redis.\n";
        return $redis;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

This function reads the configuration from `config.php` and establishes a connection to the Redis database.

#### Create a Test Script

Now, let's create a test script to verify our connection and perform some basic Redis operations. Create a file named `test_redis.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php
require_once 'redis_connect.php';

$redis = getRedisConnection();

// Set a key
$redis->set('mykey', 'Hello from Sailos Devbox!');
echo "Key set successfully.\n";

// Get a key
$value = $redis->get('mykey');
echo "Retrieved value: " . $value . "\n";

// Set a hash
$redis->hSet('myhash', 'field1', 'value1');
$redis->hSet('myhash', 'field2', 'value2');
echo "Hash set successfully.\n";

// Get hash fields
$hashValue = $redis->hGetAll('myhash');
echo "Retrieved hash: " . print_r($hashValue, true) . "\n";

// Close the connection
$redis->close();
echo "Redis connection closed.\n";
```

This script demonstrates setting and getting a key, as well as working with Redis hashes.

## Usage

To run the test script, use the following command in your Cursor terminal:

```bash
php test_redis.php
```

This will execute the script, demonstrating the connection to Redis and basic operations.

## Best Practices

1. Use environment variables or a separate configuration file for Redis credentials.
2. Handle potential errors using try-catch blocks.
3. Close the Redis connection after operations are complete.
4. Use Redis transactions for operations that need to be atomic.
5. Consider using a connection pool for better performance in production environments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify your Redis credentials in the `config.php` file.
2. Ensure your Redis database is running and accessible.
3. Check for any network restrictions in your Devbox environment.
4. Confirm that the `php-redis` extension is correctly installed.
