Redis is a popular, open-source in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, message broker, and queue. In Sailos DevBox, you can easily set up and connect to Redis databases for your development projects.

## Deploy Redis in Sailos

Sailos makes it easy to deploy a Redis database with just a few clicks. Follow these steps:

<div className='steps [&_h5]:step'>

<h5>From the Sailos desktop, click on the "Database" icon to open the Database app.</h5>

<h5>Click on the "Create New Database" button. In the deployment form:</h5>
   - Select "Redis" as the database type.
   - Choose the desired Redis version (e.g., redis-7.0.6).
   - Enter a name for your database (use lowercase letters and numbers only).
   - Adjust the CPU and Memory sliders to set the resources for your database.
   - Set the number of replicas (1 for single-node development and testing).
   - Specify the storage size (e.g., 1 Gi).
