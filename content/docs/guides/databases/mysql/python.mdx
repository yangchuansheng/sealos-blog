description: Learn how to connect to MySQL databases in Sailos Devbox using Python
---

This guide will walk you through the process of connecting to a MySQL database using Python within your Sailos Devbox project.

## Prerequisites

- [A Sailos Devbox project](/docs/guides/fundamentals/create-a-project) with Python environment
- [A MySQL database created using the Database app in Sailos](./)

## Activating the Python Environment

Before you start, you need to activate the Python virtual environment in your Devbox. Open the terminal within Cursor IDE and run:

```bash
source ./bin/activate
```

You should see your prompt change, indicating that the virtual environment is now active.

## Installing Required Packages

In your Cursor terminal, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

This command installs:
- `mysql-connector-python`: The official MySQL driver for Python
- `python-dotenv`: A Python package that allows you to load environment variables from a .env file

## Connection Setup

<div className='steps [&_h4]:step'>

#### Set up the environment variables

First, let's set up the environment variables for our database connection. Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```ini title=".env"
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=3306
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual MySQL credentials from the Database app in Sailos.

#### Create a database connection module

Create a new file named `db_connection.py` with the following content:

```python title="db_connection.py"
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error
 
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
 
def get_db_connection():
    try:
        # First, connect without specifying a database
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=os.getenv('DB_HOST'),
            user=os.getenv('DB_USER'),
            password=os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
            port=os.getenv('DB_PORT')
        )
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            
            # Create the database if it doesn't exist
            db_name = os.getenv('DB_NAME')
            cursor.execute(f"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS {db_name}")
            
            # Close the initial connection
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
            
            # Reconnect with the database specified
            connection = mysql.connector.connect(
                host=os.getenv('DB_HOST'),
                user=os.getenv('DB_USER'),
                password=os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
                database=db_name,
                port=os.getenv('DB_PORT')
            )
            
            if connection.is_connected():
                print(f"Successfully connected to MySQL database '{db_name}'")
                return connection
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to MySQL database: {e}")
        return None
 
def close_connection(connection):
    if connection:
        connection.close()
        print("MySQL connection closed")
```

This module provides two main functions:

1. `get_db_connection()`: This function establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the credentials stored in the environment variables. It returns the connection object if successful, or None if an error occurs.

2. `close_connection(connection)`: This function closes the database connection when it's no longer needed.

#### Create a test script

Now, let's create a test script to verify our connection and perform some basic database operations. Create a file named `test_mysql.py` with the following content:

```python title="test_mysql.py"
from mysql.connector import Error
from db_connection import get_db_connection, close_connection

def create_table(cursor):
    create_table_query = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(100)
    )
    """
    cursor.execute(create_table_query)
    print("Table 'employees' created successfully")

def insert_employee(cursor, name, email):
    insert_query = "INSERT INTO employees (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)"
    cursor.execute(insert_query, (name, email))
    print(f"Employee {name} inserted successfully")

def get_all_employees(cursor):
    select_query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
    cursor.execute(select_query)
    employees = cursor.fetchall()
    for employee in employees:
        print(f"ID: {employee[0]}, Name: {employee[1]}, Email: {employee[2]}")

def main():
    connection = get_db_connection()
    if connection:
        try:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            
            create_table(cursor)
            
            insert_employee(cursor, "John Doe", "john@example.com")
            insert_employee(cursor, "Jane Smith", "jane@example.com")
            
            print("\nAll Employees:")
            get_all_employees(cursor)
            
            connection.commit()
        except Error as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
        finally:
            if cursor:
                cursor.close()
            close_connection(connection)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's break down the main components of this script:

1. `create_table(cursor)`: This function creates a table named 'employees' if it doesn't already exist. It demonstrates how to execute a CREATE TABLE SQL statement.

2. `insert_employee(cursor, name, email)`: This function inserts a new employee record into the 'employees' table. It shows how to use parameterized queries to safely insert data.

3. `get_all_employees(cursor)`: This function retrieves all records from the 'employees' table and prints them. It demonstrates how to execute a SELECT query and fetch results.

4. `main()`: This is the main function that ties everything together. It:
   - Establishes a database connection
   - Creates the 'employees' table
   - Inserts two sample employees
   - Retrieves and prints all employees
   - Handles any exceptions that might occur
   - Ensures that the cursor and connection are properly closed

</div>

## Running the Test Script

To run the test script, make sure your virtual environment is activated, then execute:

```bash
python test_mysql.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating successful connection, table creation, data insertion, and retrieval.

## Best Practices

1. Always activate the virtual environment before running your Python scripts or installing packages.
2. Use environment variables to store sensitive information like database credentials.
3. Close database connections and cursors after use to free up resources.
4. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
5. Handle exceptions appropriately to manage potential errors.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Ensure you've activated the virtual environment with `source ./bin/activate`.
2. Verify that your MySQL database is running and accessible.
3. Double-check your database credentials in the `.env` file.
4. Check the MySQL logs in the Database app for any error messages.
