Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. In Sailos DevBox, you can easily set up and connect to Kafka clusters for your development projects.

## Deploy Kafka in Sailos

Sailos makes it easy to deploy a Kafka cluster with just a few clicks. Follow these steps:

<div className='steps [&_h5]:step'>

<h5>From the Sailos desktop, click on the "Database" icon to open the Database app.</h5>

<h5>Click on the "Create New Database" button. In the deployment form:</h5>
   - Select "Kafka" as the database type.
   - Choose the desired Kafka version (e.g., kafka-3.3.2).
   - Enter a name for your Kafka cluster (use lowercase letters and numbers only).
   - Adjust the CPU and Memory sliders to set the resources for your Kafka brokers.
   - Set the number of brokers (1 for single-node development and testing, 3 or more for production).
   - Specify the storage size for each broker (e.g., 3 Gi).
